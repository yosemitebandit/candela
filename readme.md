### tetris game

 1. show a 3x3 empty grid
 2. populate it with 4 colored squares
 3. hide the squares
 4. let the person try to find them
 5. they're right --> again but bigger!
 6. they're wrong --> repeat with same size

would be nice:
 - track total found/hidden
 - color fades
 - center the durn thing
